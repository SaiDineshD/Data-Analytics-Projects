## Project Overview

This project utilizes Jupyter Notebooks to perform the following tasks:

- Retrieve historical stock data for Tesla Inc. using Yahoo Finance API.
- Analyze stock performance, calculate key financial metrics, and visualize trends.
- Implement regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regressor) for stock price prediction.
- Explore portfolio optimization strategies, including equal-weighted and weighted portfolios.
- Implement rolling backtesting to assess model performance over time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, yfinance)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaiDineshD/stock-market-analysis.git

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   i. Historical stock data is collected using the Yahoo Finance API.
   ii. Data preprocessing includes cleaning missing values, calculating financial metrics, and feature engineering.

2. Analysis Steps:
2.1. Exploratory Data Analysis
   i. Explore stock price trends, volume, and key financial metrics.
   ii. Visualize relationships between features.
2.2. Regression Models
   i. Implement various regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regressor) for stock price prediction.
   ii. Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error.
2.3. Backtesting
   i. Implement rolling backtesting for assessing model predictions against historical data.
2.4. Portfolio Optimization
   i. Explore portfolio optimization strategies, including equal-weighted and weighted portfolios.

3. Next Steps:
  i. Extend analysis periods to evaluate model performance in different market conditions.
  ii. Experiment with advanced machine learning models.
  iii. Implement additional portfolio optimization strategies.
